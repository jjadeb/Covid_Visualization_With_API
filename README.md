# Covid_Visualization_With_API

A exploration of working with an API and pythons visualization tools. 

Created as a solo project. To view this project, navigate to `adsf`. 

## Technologies
The analysis and report was made in Google Collab, using python3 with packages such as requests, json, and pandas.

## Setup
Clone this repository. 

If needed, install Jupyter and python3 on your local machine, and set up the Jupyter kernel to run python3 code. 

Open up the report (`dsfsadf`), install the necessary packages, then run all the cells. Enjoy!
